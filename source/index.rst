🎓 Official PsychoPy Workshop (Virtual)
==================================================================================
April 14th-17th 2026. Virtual - Online training. 

Join us for an intensive, hands-on course in designing behavioural experiments — delivered by the creators of PsychoPy and Pavlovia.org.

**Format:** Four half-day sessions (13:00–17:00 UK time), covering two full days worth of post-graduate level training.

**Who is it for:** This workshop is ideal for beginners, PhD students, faculty, and industry researchers interested in using PsychoPy. No prior experience is required, though downloading the software in advance for familiarization is recommended. Experienced users will also benefit from advanced tips and best practices. Bespoke training options are available on request.

**What you’ll learn:**

- How to design and run experiments studying human behaviour (reaction times, accuracy, and more).
- Integrating Python code for flexible, customisable experiments.
- Running experiments online via Pavlovia.org for large-scale recruitment.
- Connecting experiments with hardware for physiological measurements (EEG, fMRI, eyetracking).

Whether you’re starting out with behavioural research or looking to refine your skills, this course offers interactive training and expert guidance from the team behind PsychoPy and Pavlovia.org.

💬 What Attendees say

    .. card:: **Rai Samar G Bari** PhD Cognitive Neuroscience, Durham University

        I'm grateful to the PsychoPy team for organizing an excellent workshop. The hands-on practice sessions were incredibly valuable, allowing us to create our own experiments. Rebecca was an exceptional trainer, and Sue provided great support in designing experiments during each session. Kim was also very helpful in setting up hardware connections. I highly recommend attending their workshop if you're looking to program experiments with PsychoPy.

    .. card:: **Daniele**, Univ. of L'Aquila

        The three workshops I attended were really fundamental in understanding the basics of the logic of designing and programming psychopy experiments. The lecturers were very helpful and precise. Thank you very much for the valuable events you organised.

    .. card:: **Flavia Hendler**, Haifa University 

        There is great material on YouTube for learning psychopy, but the live workshops are interactive and we  can meet the team, ask questions, and get to understand the broader logic of the psychopy/Pavlovia project. It is pleasant to get to know the people making it happen, and it is really great value for the knowledge you get.

    .. card:: **Shiyu Li**, Université de Montréal

        If you're looking to get started with PsychoPy, this workshop is an absolute must-attend. By following the patient tutors step by step to create experiments, I've learned a lot, even some insights I hadn't anticipated.

    .. card:: **Alice Rees**, Lancaster University

        You can go from being completely lost at how to use psychopy to feeling super confident in your abilities over the workshop. I've gone from 0 experiments to having 2.5 experiments built! I'm certain this would have taken me as many months to get to this stage if I was on my own.If you're interested in running studies in the lab or online then this workshop is a must!

        I would highly recommend this workshop for anyone interested in using PsychoPy for their research! The workshop is extremely well organised and Becca, Jon and the rest of the team do a fantastic job in helping you develop the confidence and skills to effectively use PsychoPy. Whether you have a specific experiment that you'd like to build, or simply want to learn the basics, this workshop caters to researchers of all programming levels.

        Useful if you are totally beginner with PsychoPy
