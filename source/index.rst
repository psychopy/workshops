💬 What Attendees say
==================================================================================

    .. card:: **Rai Samar G Bari** PhD Cognitive Neuroscience, Durham University

        I'm grateful to the PsychoPy team for organizing an excellent workshop. The hands-on practice sessions were incredibly valuable, allowing us to create our own experiments. Rebecca was an exceptional trainer, and Sue provided great support in designing experiments during each session. Kim was also very helpful in setting up hardware connections. I highly recommend attending their workshop if you're looking to program experiments with PsychoPy.

    .. card:: **Daniele**, Univ. of L'Aquila

        The three workshops I attended were really fundamental in understanding the basics of the logic of designing and programming psychopy experiments. The lecturers were very helpful and precise. Thank you very much for the valuable events you organised.

    .. card:: **Flavia Hendler**, Haifa University 

        There is great material on YouTube for learning psychopy, but the live workshops are interactive and we  can meet the team, ask questions, and get to understand the broader logic of the psychopy/Pavlovia project. It is pleasant to get to know the people making it happen, and it is really great value for the knowledge you get.

    .. card:: **Shiyu Li**, Université de Montréal

        If you're looking to get started with PsychoPy, this workshop is an absolute must-attend. By following the patient tutors step by step to create experiments, I've learned a lot, even some insights I hadn't anticipated.

    .. card:: **Alice Rees**, Lancaster University

        You can go from being completely lost at how to use psychopy to feeling super confident in your abilities over the workshop. I've gone from 0 experiments to having 2.5 experiments built! I'm certain this would have taken me as many months to get to this stage if I was on my own.If you're interested in running studies in the lab or online then this workshop is a must!

        I would highly recommend this workshop for anyone interested in using PsychoPy for their research! The workshop is extremely well organised and Becca, Jon and the rest of the team do a fantastic job in helping you develop the confidence and skills to effectively use PsychoPy. Whether you have a specific experiment that you'd like to build, or simply want to learn the basics, this workshop caters to researchers of all programming levels.

        Useful if you are totally beginner with PsychoPy
