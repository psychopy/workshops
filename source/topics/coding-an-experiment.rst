  **When?** 

  * September 18th, 15:30 - 17:00 (UK time) **[fully booked]**
  * October 2nd, 15:30 - 17:00 (UK time)

  **Where?** Virtual (Zoom)

  **What will I learn?** This workshop will introduce you to how to code an experiment from scratch using python code. **This is a beginners python workshop, we will not assume any knowledge of python code in advance of this session**. The topics covered in this session will include:

  * Basic variable types (Integers, Strings, Dictionaries).
  * Presenting stimuli and gathering responses using code.  
  * Storing data and writing output files using python code. 

  In general, we do not recommend coding experiments from scratch (even the developers of PsychoPy use PsychoPy Builder to make experiments!). However, coding experiments is a fun, visual approach to learning to code. Also, coding an experiment from scratch gives a better idea what is going on "under the hood" of PsychoPy Builder!

  **Why attend a workshop?** Unlike a YouTube video or webinar, this is a "hands on" learning experience with a member of our team to guide you. You make an experiment at the same time as us, you can ask questions in real-time. 

  **How can I register?** Book a ticket or apply for a waiver.
