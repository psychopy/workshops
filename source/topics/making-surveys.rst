  **When?** August 30th, 15:30 - 17:00 (UK time)

  **Where?** Virtual (Zoom)

  **What will I learn?** This workshop will introduce you to how to create high quality surveys and questionnaires with Pavlovia surveys. The topics covered in this session will include:

  * Setting up a basic survey
  * Applying logic to the flow of your surveys (i.e. if/else logic)
  * Daisy chaining your survey with other platforms 

  **Why attend a workshop?** Unlike a YouTube video or webinar, this is a "hands on" learning experience with a member of our team to guide you. You make an experiment at the same time as us, you can ask questions in real-time. 

  **How can I register?** Book a ticket or apply for a waiver.
